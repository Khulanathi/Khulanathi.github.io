                            Med-Mobi, this is a medical chatbot I created with my group members: Nkosinathi Mnguni and Lawrence Sipopo.
                            <br><br>
                            I handled 90% of the python, I got the training model from online, I created all the functions for booking, cancelling and reschedule appointments, added all the intents in the intents.json file. I was involved in 40% of the logic behind fetching and storing data in firebase and creating firebase queries.
                            45% in the overall layout and how the app should look but I didn't know react at the time. Designed the structure of the database which we used firebase for it.


                            <br><br>
                            Mobi can be greeted and talked to, it can: book, cancel, reschedule and display appointments. Additional features such as calculating difference between dates, getting the users latitude and longitude, and connecting with firebase.

                            I created this page or website on my own by myself, it's purely HTML and CSS, front-end development has not been my strong point but I would be lying if I said it was my weak point.  <br><br>
                            
                            This webpage is my portfolio, details about me can be found here, my previous projects, all my certificates and my programming skills. This page is just to illastrate my front-end development and my knowledge of HTML and CSS and at the same time fit details that cant fit in my cv and my cv at the same time. <br> <br>

                <p>I have studied and used a lot of programming languages, below I have listed and explained all the languages I've used, even HTML even though it's not a programming language. I listed them from the most recently learned or used. Here's my list: <br> <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <i>Java</i><br>
                            <span>
                                Well java is something new to me I started learning it in February 2023 haven't really applied my knowledge I am still to experiment with it but so far it look like a language I'd like.

                        <li>
                            <i>React</i><br>
                            <span>
                                Currently Learning it for mobile app and web development haven't done anything yet but I have a solid bases as I worked with someone on the Med Mobi project who handled React Native.

                        <li>
                            <i>Python</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                Really enjoyed python, I built a chatbot with it, it was collaborative project, but I handled 90% of the python, learned about NLTK, lemmatizing, I built booking, cancelling, displaying function that need to format things like time date, convert data received from firebase and manipulate it, learned how to fetch data from online or rather from a specific website based on user input. The Med Mobi project. <br><br>

                        </li>
    
    
                        <li>
                            <i>PHP</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                PHP, I learned PHP in 2022 I used it for 6 months and have never really used it again not because I hated it or it was difficult, but I needed to learn python therefore never really got the time again, I only did a basic project with it.
                                <br><br>
                            </span>

                        <li>
                            <i>PL/SQL</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                SQL, it's really enjoyable using it, I started learning SQL in 2021 it was challenging and difficult but I really adored it. moved on to PL/SQL whereby we used functions procedures variables and all that and I still liked it, fetching storing data in a database accessing tables based on primary or foreign keys, substring data from database it's an awesome language, recently I even got familiar with firebase but it works totally different, but a real time database was really nice to use as well. <br><br>
                            </span>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <i>JavaScript</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                I learned JavaScript in 2021 but I've never really used it only practice and online videos currently learning react which uses JavaScript and html therefore I feel like I will get more comfortable with it. <br><br>
                            </span>
                        </li>
    
                        <li>
                            <i>C++</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                C++ is honestly my first love this is where I learn about programming languages classes, functions arrays and all of that, I never even attended class I just read the whole text book I honestly love using C++ it's my comfort zone and any new language I learn I usually compare the syntax with c++ syntax then I get used to that language. <br><br>
                            </span>
                        </li>

                           <i>Visual Basic</i> <br>
                            <span>
                                I learned visual basic when started at TUT during my IT foundation year, we used to move objects and make them talk but this was too easy I never liked it you just joined blocks with specific instructions together but I'm fairly good at it and I can adapt to using this anytime. <br><br>

                                In high school we used to learn CAT and that's actually where my love for code and computers started, HTML was something I started learning back in 2016 and CSS I learned back in 2019 but I'm very familiar with both currently as this webpage in its own is built using the two and I proudly did so. <br><br>

I initially wanted to study computer science I believed it would allow me to have a more broad concept of computers, the network and software, due to situations and my final grade 12 marks I couldn't get in other university and the only university that welcomed me was Tshwane University of Technology (TUT), and I started in 2019 doing foundation, 2020 I joined peer education and 2021 2022 I became the chairperson of the clinic at my campus, 2023 February 7'th is when I found out that I had met all the requirements to obtain my national diploma, and currently I'm doing my advanced diploma in COMPUTE SCIENCE. <br> <br>
